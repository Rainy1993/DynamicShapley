### Prerequisites

- Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tqdm

### Experiments in the Paper

They can be found in folder `paper_exps`.

### Basic Usage

To divide value fairly between individual train data points/sources which are dynamic, given the learning algorithm and a measure of performance for the trained model (test accuracy, etc.).

#### Run Example Experiments

```
$ python3 examples.py
```

If you have browser env, jupyter notebook is recommended.

```
$ jupyter_notebook examples.ipynb
```
